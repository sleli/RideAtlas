# Clean Code – Reference for LLM

## How to use

Paste this entire file as a **system prompt** (or prepend to your fine‑tuning corpus). The model must treat every rule below as *hard constraints*.

---

## 1. Core Principles &#x20;

* **Readability first.** Code is read >10× more than it is written.
* **Express intent.** Every name, function, class must reveal *why* it exists.
* **Keep it small.** Short functions, small classes, minimal dependencies.
* **One level of abstraction per function.** Avoid mixing low‑ and high‑level concepts.
* **No duplication.** Extract common concepts, DRY.
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).** A module should have one reason to change.
* **Command‑Query Separation.** Functions either *do* something or *answer* something—not both.
* **Fail fast.** Detect errors early, handle them once.

## 2. Naming

* Use **intention‑revealing**, pronounceable, searchable names.
* Avoid encodings (`m_`, Hungarian, types).
* Prefer *noun* names for classes, *verb* names for functions.
* Replace magic numbers with named constants.

### Bad → Good (MIT, clean‑code‑javascript)

```javascript
// ❌ Bad
let d;                // elapsed time in days
function zz(a) { … }  // zips and zaps?

// ✅ Good
let daysElapsed;
function compressAndArchive(files) { … }
```

## 3. Functions

* ≤ 20 lines ideally, ≤ 3 parameters.
* No side effects unless the name shouts it (`saveUserToDb`).
* Return early to reduce nesting.
* Prefer **exceptions** over error codes.

### Example

```javascript
// ❌ Bad
function emailClients(clients) {
  for (let i = 0; i < clients.length; i++) {
    let client = clients[i];
    if (client.active) {
      email(client);
    }
  }
}

// ✅ Good
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients
    .filter(isActive)
    .forEach(email);
}
```

## 4. Comments

* Use comments to explain *why*, not *what*.
* Prefer self‑explanatory code over comments.
* Delete obsolete or TODO comments.
* Javadoc/KDoc only where tooling requires.

## 5. Formatting

* Keep a consistent indentation (spaces > tabs).
* Group related code vertically.
* Use blank lines to separate concepts.
* Each variable is declared as close as possible to its usage.

## 6. Objects & Data Structures

* Hide internal state behind public methods.
* Data objects have no behavior; objects have both data & behavior.
* Prefer immutability where practical.

## 7. Error Handling

* Use exceptions not return codes.
* Provide context in exception messages.
* Don’t return `null`; use `Optional`/`Maybe` or throw.

## 8. Tests

* Three qualities: **Fast, Independent, Repeatable**.
* One assertion per test is ideal.
* Use descriptive test names (`shouldDepositMoneyWhenAccountIsOpen`).
